### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About Me

ðŸ˜„ I am both a detailed and focused worker, as well as a patient, collaborative and direct communicator and team member.

ðŸ”­ My technical skills include React, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. In additional to technical skills, I have strong communication and collaboration skills from a 8 year career working in the environmental field as a project manager.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and TyoeScript.

ðŸ˜„ My drive to constantly learn has led me to career experiences that range from laboratory analyst to project management and now to growing as a software developer. Each experience presented unique challenges that all influenced the person that I am now. 

âš¡ When not coding, I can be found rock climbing and exploring the mountains.
